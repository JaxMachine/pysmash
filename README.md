A python wrapper to smash.gg Developer API

Smash.gg API: https://help.smash.gg/hc/en-us/articles/217471947-API-Access

This is still a work in progress, especially since Smash.gg's development API seems very nascent at the moment.

Test suite and examples on how to use it will follow soon.

For large tournaments, you might want to avoid asking for a complete list of sets due to possible memory constraints.

Caching responses from this Library is probably a good idea :)

If you have any issues or want to improve the wrapper, please open an issue/pull request.
